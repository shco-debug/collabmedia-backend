Theme Based Posts Search (Platform Leaning)

#) Need to use same design and data structure, so that we can reuse all the features implemented for general media listing.
	- Posts schema is different than the general media data structure
	- We need to transform DS for all required cases in both ways 
		- Client to server and 
		- Server to client data passing.

#) There may be same media multiple time posted (reposts - With different text by different users) 
	- Which post to populate? 
		- all post copies or 
		- only media owner's post?
		

#) We are still not clear that how we have to map keywords with posts, please confirm?

#) What if user click on a post?
	- The new posting page will open media from clicked post on left and comment on right.
	- Now suppose he doesn't change the comment from post and repost it to his current board?
